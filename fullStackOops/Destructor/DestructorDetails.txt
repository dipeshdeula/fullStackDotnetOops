Destructor
- A destructor is a special method that is used to destroy an object of a class.
- It is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is destroyed.
- However, unlike methods, a destructor :
	-has the same name as the class preceded by a tilde (~)
	-does not have parameters or return type

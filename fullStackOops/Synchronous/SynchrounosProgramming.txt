Synchronous Programmin (ex: Communication in telephone)

- It is a type of programming in which code execution occurs in a single, sequential order.
- when a synchronous method is called,
 - program waits for method to complete before moving to next line of code.

-This means that the program will block , or pause , until the method completes

- Synchronous programming is easier to understand and implement, 
but it can be less efficient than asynchronous programming, especially 
in a multi-threaded environment.

Abstract Class

- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated.
- Instead , it serves as a base class for other classes to inherit from.
- They are used to define a common set of properties that derived classes must implement.
- Abstract classes can have abstract methods, which are methods that are declared but not implemented.
- Abstract methods must be implemented by any class that inherits from the abstract class.
- Abstract classes can also have non-abstract methods, which are methods that are implemented in the abstract class and can be used by derived classes.
- Abstract classes are defined using the abstract keyword.

//Create an abstract class 
abstract class Test
{
	//fields and methods
}

//try to create an object language
//throws an error

Test obj = new Test();

- An abstract class can have abstract methods (method without body),
non-abstract methods(method with the body), and fields.

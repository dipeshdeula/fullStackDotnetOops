Static Class

-Static Means Something which cannot be instantiated
-You cannot create an object of a static class,
-and cannot access the members of a static class using an object.
-You can access the members of a static class using the class name itself.
-Static class members are shared among all the objects of the class.
-Static class members are created only once and shared among all the objects of the class.
-Static class members are created when the class is loaded into memory and destroyed when the class is unloaded
-Static class members are created in the memory at the time of class loading.
-C# static class cannot contain instance constructors
-Apply static modifier before the class name and after access modifier to make a class static.


Advantages:
-Static members can be accessed directly with their class name.
-Static members are created only once and shared among all the objects of the class.
-Static keword is used before the class keyword in a class definition to declare a static class.

Example:
Below is an example of a static class in C#.
The calculator class is a static . All the member of it are also static.

public static class Calculator
{
	private static int _resultStorage = 0;
	public static string Type = "Arthimetic";

	public static int Add(int a, int b)
	{
		return a + b;
	}
	public static void Store(int result)
	{
		_resultStorage = result;
	}

}

Extension Methods
-Extension methods , as the name suggests, are additonal methods
-These methods create and add new methods to existing class without creating new child class.
-They are the special type of the static methods that can be called as instance methods.
-We can add extension methods in both predefined classes and user created custom classes.

int i = 10;
bool result = i.IsGreaterThan(100); //returns false

-In the following example, IsGreaterThan() is an extension method for int type.
-which returns true if value of the int variable is greater than the supplied integer parameter

# We need to consider the following points to define an extension method:
 - An extension method shoubl be static method of a static class.
 -It must have this keyword associate with class name
 -The class name should be the first parameter in the parameter list.

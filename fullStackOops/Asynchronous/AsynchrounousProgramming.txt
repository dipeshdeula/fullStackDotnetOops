Asynchronous Programming (ex: texting/chatting)

- It is an efficinet apporach towards acitivities blocked or access is delayed
- If an activity is blocked like this in a synchronous process.
-then the complete application waits and it takes more time.
- The application stops responding.
- Using the asynchronous approach, the appliaction continue with other talk as well.

Asynchronous Programming patterns

There are 3 patterns for implementing asynchronous programming in .NET:
 - Asynchronous Programming Model(APM)
 - Event-Based Asychronous pattern(EAP)
 -Task-Based Asynchrous  pattern(TAP)

 -All of these patterns are used in .NET to provide asynchronous programming support,
 -and Task-Based Asynchrous pattern(TAP) is the most recent and recommended pattern

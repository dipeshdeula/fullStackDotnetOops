Property
-Property is a class member that exposes the class private fields
-Internally, C# properties are special methods called accessors
-It has two accessors, a get property accessor or a getter and a set property accessor or a setter
-A get accessor returns a property value and a set accessor assigns a new value
-The value keyword represents the value of a property
-Properties are used to access and modify private fields

The general form of declaring a property is a follows:
{
	get{}
	set{}
}

#usage of properties
-C# provides can be read-only or write-only properties
-Read-only properties have only a get accessor
-Write-only properties have only a set accessor
-We can have logic while setting values in the c# properties.
-We make fields of class private, so that fields can't be accessed from outside the class directly.

-Now we are forced to use C# Properties for setting or getting values.

Types of properties
1) Read-Write -> Acessors: get;set;
2) Read-Only -> Acessors: get;
3) Write-Only -> Acessors: set;
4) Auto-Implemented -> Acessors: get; set;

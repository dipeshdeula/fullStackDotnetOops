Encapsulation

- Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit.
- It is the mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates.
- In a different way, encapsulation is a protective shield that prevents
the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.
- Encapsulation leads to the concept of data hiding or information hiding.
- Encapsulation can be achieved by: Declaring all the variables in the class
as private and writing public methods in the class to set and get the values of variables.

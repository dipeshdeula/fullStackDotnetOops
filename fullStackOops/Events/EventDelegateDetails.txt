Events

- Events in C#, being a subset of delegates are defined by using ...delegates.
- An event is an encapsulated delegate
- To raise an event in C# you need a publisher,
- And to receive and handle an event you need a subscriber or multiple subscriber.
- These are usually implemented as publisher and subscriber classes.

Syntax:
	event delegate_name.event_name;


Annonymous Method
- As the name suggests , an anonymous method is method without a name.
- Anonymous method can be defined using the delegate keyword.
- They can be assigned to a variable of delegate type
- Anonymous method can access variables defined in an outer function


#Example

public delegate void print(int value);

static void Main(string[] args)
{
	Print print = delegate (int val)
	{
		Console.WriteLine("Inside Anonymous method. value"+val);

	}

	print(500);
}

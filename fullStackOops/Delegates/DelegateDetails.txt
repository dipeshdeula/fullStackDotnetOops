Delegates

- A Delegates is a pointer to a method.
- But it is object-oriented, secured and type-safe than function pointer.
- That means, a delegate holds the address of a method which can be called using that delegates
- For static method, delegate encapsulates method only.
- But for instance method, it encapsulates method and instance both.
- There are three steps involved while working with delegates:
	# Declare a delegate
	# Set a target Method
	# Invoke a delegate


Types of Delegates
1) SingleCast Delegates -> A single function or method is reffered as a Delegate
2) MultiCast Delegates -> Refers to the delegation of multiple functions or methods

Annonymous Types

-It is introduced in C# 3.0
-Anonymous types allow us to create an object that has read only properties
-Anonymous object is an object that has no explict type
-C# Compiler generates type name and is accessible only for the current block of code.
-There are best for the "use and throw" types.
-To create anonymous types , we must use new operator with an object initializer

. In the below Example, we are creating anonymous types by using "new" keyword with the object initalizer

var annoyInfo = new
{
	Fname = "Dipesh",
	Lname = "Deula"
};

Console.WriteLine("Fname:" + annoyInfo.Lname);
